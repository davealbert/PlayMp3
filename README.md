PlayMp3
=======

Play mp3 audio files added to the app via iTunes.


I often download podcasts on my work computer. My iPhone 
library is not managed by it, but by my home computer.


This app allows me to copy sound files into the app via
iTunes, without affecting my iTunes Library.


I have also added support to download (one file at a time)
a file into the App Audio Library from the Internet.
